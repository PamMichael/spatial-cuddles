# uneven_grids
# Runs with BLUElink sst but I need to find a sharable example dataset.  The netCDF4 attached (NCEP Rean, daily, 1 year) is not an ideal example as it is evenly spaced and huge. The purpose of this dataset was to update the functions for netcdf4. I short-cutted range-related color plotting issues and used a different color scale.

# Thanks for the thoughts / help!
