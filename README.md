# uneven_grids
# the netCDF4 attached (NCEP Rean, daily, 1 year) is not an ideal example as it is evenly spaced and huge, but I'll look at irregularly spaced data tomorrow afternoon when I'm on the network. The purpose of this dataset was to update the functions for netcdf4. I'm assuming the raster isn't plotting properly due to the colorscale (Kelvin) but maybe there is an issue I haven't dealth with?

# Thanks for the thoughts / help!
